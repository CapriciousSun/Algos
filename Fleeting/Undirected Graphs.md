An undirected [[Graphs|graph]] is a graph where the edges go both directions.

## Depth-First Search
Using [[Depth-First Search|depth-first search]] for undirected graph might not be economical, especially not for finding the geodesic (shortest) path between nodes. ![[Pasted image 20250210172533.png]]

## Breadth-First Search
[[Breadth-First Search|Breadth-first search]] is far more useful, as it gives information regarding the distance between nodes. ![[Pasted image 20250210173227.png]]
